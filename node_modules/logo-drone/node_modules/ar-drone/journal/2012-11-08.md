# control <-> navdata circular dependency

So I have a circular dependency between navdata and control:

* control needs navdata to provide a callback to takeoff
* navdata needs control to request more navdata as needed

The following solutions seem feasable:

## a) Create circular dependency

Problems:
* Nasty
* Means I have to manipulate the navdata object after creating it to give
  it control.
* Breaks the isolation of navdata and control

## b) Move higher level control to client

Example:

```
client.takeoff();
client.land();
```

Problems:
* Unclear what the client object should do and what the control object should
  do.


## c) Have the control listen to all navdata events

Problems:
* None, as long as I'm ok with emitting all navdata events

# Side quest: emit 'data' events if not all navdata is included?

Problems:
* may cause navdata events to not be emitted for an unknown amount of time

# control internals

I'm wondering how to do the control internals, this may be right:

* control.atStream.ref(); control.atStream.flush(); -> emits 'data' ControlMessage
* control.atStream.pipe(control.udpStream);
* udp emits what it is sending
